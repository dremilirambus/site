<h2 style="text-align: center;">NEW JERSEY NOTICE FORM</h2>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Notice of Psychologists' Policies and Practices to Protect the Privacy of Your Health Information</h3>

<br>

<h3>I. Uses and Disclosures for Treatment, Payment, and Health Care Operations</h3>

We may use or disclose your protected health information (PHI), for treatment, payment, and health care operations purposes with your consent. To help clarify these terms, here are some definitions:

<ul>

<li><i>"PHI"</i> refers to information in your health record that could identify you.</li>

<br>

<li><i>"Treatment, Payment and Health Care Operations"</i></li>

<br>

<ul>
	<li><i>Treatment</i> is when we provide, coordinate or manage your health care and other services related to your health care. An example of treatment would be when we consult with another health care provider, such as your family physician or another psychologist.</li>

	<br>

	<li><i>Payment</i> is when we obtain reimbursement for your healthcare. Examples of payment are when we disclose your PHI to your health insurer to obtain reimbursement for your health care or to determine eligibility or coverage.</li>

	<br>

	<li><i>Health Care Operations</i> are activities that relate to the performance and operation of our practice. Examples of health care operations are quality assessment and improvement activities, business-related matters such as audits and administrative services, and case management and care coordination.</li>

</ul>

<br>

<li><i>"Use"</i> applies only to activities within our [office, clinic, practice group, etc.] such as sharing, employing, applying, utilizing, examining, and analyzing information that identifies you.</li>

<br>

<li><i>"Disclosure"</i> applies to activities outside of our [office, clinic, practice group, etc.], such as releasing, transferring, or providing access to information about you to other parties.</li>

</ul>

</p>

<br>

<p>

<h3>II. Uses and Disclosures Requiring Authorization</h3>

We may use or disclose PHI for purposes outside of treatment, payment, and health care operations when your appropriate authorization is obtained. An <i>"authorization"</i> is written permission above and beyond the general consent that permits only specific disclosures. In those instances when we are asked for information for purposes outside of treatment, payment and health care operations, we will obtain an authorization from you before releasing this information.

<br><br>

You may revoke all such authorizations (of PHI) at any time, provided each revocation is in writing. You may not revoke an authorization to the extent that (1) We have relied on that authorization; or (2) if the authorization was obtained as a condition of obtaining insurance coverage, and the law provides the insurer the right to contest the claim under the policy.

</p>

<br>

<p>

<h3>III. Uses and Disclosures with Neither Consent nor Authorization</h3>

We may use or disclose PHI without your consent or authorization in the following circumstances:

<ul>

<li><i>Child Abuse:</i> If we have reasonable cause to believe that a child has been subject to abuse, we must report this immediately to the New Jersey Division of Youth and Family Services.</li>

<br>

<li><i>Adult and Domestic Abuse:</i> If we reasonably believe that a vulnerable adult is the subject of abuse, neglect, or exploitation, we may report the information to the county adult protective services provider.</li>

<br>

<li><i>Health Oversight:</i> If the New Jersey State Board of Psychological Examiners issues a subpoena, we may be compelled to testify before the Board and produce your relevant records and papers.</li>

<br>

<li><i>Judicial or Administrative Proceedings:</i> If you are involved in a court proceeding and a request is made for information about the professional services that we have provided you and/or the records thereof, such information is privileged under state law, and we must not release this information without written authorization from you or your legally appointed representative, or a court order. This privilege does not apply when you are being evaluated for a third party or where the evaluation is court ordered. We must inform you in advance if this is the case.</li>

<br>

<li><i>Serious Threat to Health or Safety:</i> If you communicate to us a threat of imminent serious physical violence against a readily identifiable victim or yourself or the public and we believe you intend to carry out that threat, we must take steps to warn and protect. We also must take such steps if we believe you intend to carry out such violence, even if you have not made a specific verbal threat. The steps we take to warn and protect may include arranging for you to be admitted to a psychiatric unit of a hospital or other health care facility, advising the police of your threat and the identity of the intended victim, warning the intended victim or his or her parents if the intended victim is under 18, and warning your parents if you are under 18.</li>

<br>

<li><i>Worker's Compensation:</i> If you file a worker's compensation claim, we may be required to release relevant information from your mental health records to a participant in the worker's compensation case, a reinsurer, the health care provider, medical and non-medical experts in connection with the case, the Division of Worker's Compensation, or the Compensation Rating and Inspection Bureau.</li>

</ul>

There may be additional disclosures of PHI that we are required or permitted by law to make without your consent or authorization, however the disclosures listed above are the most common.

</p>

<br>

<p>

<h3>IV. Patient's Rights and Psychologist's Duties</h3>

<br>

<li><i>Right to Receive Confidential Communications by Alternative Means and at Alternative Locations</i> - You have the right to request and receive confidential communications of PHI by alternative means and at alternative locations.

<br>

<li><i>Right to Inspect and Copy</i> - You have the right to inspect or obtain a copy (or both) of PHI in our mental health and billing records used to make decisions about you for as long as the PHI is maintained in the record.

<br>

On your request, we will discuss with you the details of the accounting process.</li>
